# ðŸš€ Playwright Test Control Methods

This repository demonstrates how to control test execution using **skip, only, and slow** methods in Playwright.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **Skip Tests**: Prevent specific tests from running
- âœ… **Conditional Skipping**: Skip tests based on browser type
- âœ… **Run Only Specific Tests**: Execute a single test with `test.only`
- âœ… **Slow Test Execution**: Extend test timeout for specific tests

## ðŸ›  Run the Tests

```sh
npx playwright test tests/annotations/annotations.spec.js --project chromium --headed
```
